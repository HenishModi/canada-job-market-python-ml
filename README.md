## 🔹 Part 1: Python + ML Analysis

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **ML Models** → trend forecasting, salary estimation

### 📑 Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning → handling nulls, formatting dates, normalizing salaries  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → province/job distributions, salary ranges  
3. Predictive Modeling → ML models for salary and trend forecasting  
4. Insights → demand analysis, role distribution, growth potential  

### 📊 Example Outputs
- Province-wise job counts  
- Job title frequency distribution  
- Predicted salaries using ML  
- Forecasted job posting growth
