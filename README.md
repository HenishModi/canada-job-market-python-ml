## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning (Salary Prediction)
A simple **Linear Regression** model is trained to predict salaries using:
- Province
- Job Title
- Month

**Example output:**  
```
R^2 score on test set: 0.72
Predicted salary for Ontario Data Analyst (2023-08): $65,400
Predicted salary for BC Data Scientist (2023-10): $82,100
```
